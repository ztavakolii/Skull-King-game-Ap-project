## Description:
+ #### In this project, we implement the Skull King game with the C++ and Qt framework.
  
+ SkullKing is a mental game (which takes place in 7 rounds and each round has twice the number of rounds in hand) which is based on playing with cards and we have implemented it for 2, 3 or 4 people.

+ In this game, we have three main types of cards, namely parrot cards, map cards, and treasure cards. From each of these cards, depending on the number of players, we have 8 or 11 cards with numbers 1 to 8 or 1 to 11(8 for two or three people and 11 for 4 people), these three types of cards are superior to They do not have each other, but the card with more number has more value. Also, a ruling card called the pirate flag card, which is numbered from 1 to 8 or 11 depending on the number of players, like the previous cards, this card is superior to the previous 3 cards and can be used by players in certain situations can use it. In addition to these, we have role cards called skull king, queen and pirate cards. 3 or 4 skull king and queen cards depending on the number of players and 4 pirate cards. These cards are the top of all cards and the player has no limit to use them.
  
+ **Note**: To play, one of the players must become a server and the other players take the role of the client and connect to the server by entering the server's IP address and continue the game. Note that clients can connect to the server if they are connected to the same Internet network.

+ We have used object-oriented programming in C++ in designing this program. In addition we have used artificial intelligence to generate most of the game background pictures.
